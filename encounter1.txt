The Friendly Traveller offers to share their baked cherry pie with you! 
They seem to look genuine and happy.

1. Gladly accept their offer to share their baked cherry pie.
2. Politely decline.
3. Attack them immediately with all the fury of the elements.
4. Simply walk away.

1. You eat the pie, feel woozy, black out, and wake up naked with all your gold having been stolen.
2. You walk away.
3. You attack and defeat the traveller. Costing 1 stamina and losing 1 health but gaining 10 gold from the bloody corpse of the smiling and non deceased friendly traveller.
4. As you walk away the traveller throws the hot pie at you, dealing 1 damage.
